1. It will be there in the child as well. As long as we export it properly.
2. It will be passed down as a enviorment variable to the child process. This will be converted to shell variable later on.
3. foo='() { echo hello; }; /bin/sh"
4. No because it will not be interpreted as a function and therefore bash will not parse and execute it.
5. Bash needs to be executed and we need to pass in an environment variable.
6. Through -A, -e, and -H command arguments in curl. These will be HTTP headers that give the program extra info.
7. If there is no function then no.
8. This was an honest mistake that can be overlooked. Never let mixing of code with data.
9. No because they are not environment variables that get executed by bash.
10. This is a reverse shell.
11. /bin/cat < /dev/machine2 > /dev/machine3
12. Just the regular function will continue because enviornment variables is NULL.
13. This time it will work because the program passes the environment variable in.
14. THe CGI calls bash and so does the system funtion. So there is no difference.
