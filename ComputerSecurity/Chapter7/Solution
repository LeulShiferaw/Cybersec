1. Yes it does.
2. Yes it does. We can open the root file such as "passwd", then change it back so it passes faccess, then change it back again.
3. Three. Because the first open, then the second access, then the second open.
4. No. Because it is atomic.
5. Not when we can renable it because our code injection for buffer overflow can also renable it.
6. Yes. You start with the privileged file you want to open, and then switch between fp = ... and stat("...", ...) to a file that can be opened by the real user ID.
7. I think that this one doesn't have a race condition. The file descriptor points to an open file and doesn't take symlinks into consideration.
8. The file my be used by more than one process. (This is the best answer I could come up with).
9. Yes between lines 1 and 2 switch to privileged file, then between 2 and 3 switch back, then between 3 and 11 switch to privileged again.
10. Line 1: eff_uid = geteuid()
    Line 3: seteuid(getuid())
    Line 6: seteuid(eff_uid)
