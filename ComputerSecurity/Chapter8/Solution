1. It prints "World". I verified with experiment
2. When you change something in the memory.
3. a. The memory is duplicated, then process table points to the new memory, and then it is written in that place.
   b. It redirects back to the file (on the first mapped area) between the process table change and the file is written. The OS doesn't verify permissions anymore.
   c. We can write to any read-only file using this technique. For example, we can add a root user to /etc/passwd
4. Yes I believe so. But hasn't been verified with experiment.
5. No. Because we can't write to the same /proc/.../mem file. They are two different things if it is different processes.
6. /etc/group and /etc/shadow
7. No. That is why we do read and write to the /proc/... file.
8. Because we are opening a read-only file. There are other restrictions for that. That is hy we do read/write on /proc/... file.
